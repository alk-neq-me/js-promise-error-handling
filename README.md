# JavaScript Promise Error Handling Patterns

Welcome to the JavaScript Promise Error Handling Patterns repository! This repository demonstrates different approaches to error handling in asynchronous JavaScript code using Promises. The primary focus is on two error handling patterns: `try`-`catch` and the Higher-Order Function (HOF) approach.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- [`asyncs.js`](https://github.com/alk-neq-me/js-promise-error-handling/blob/main/asyncs.js): This JavaScript file showcases various async functions with different error scenarios and demonstrates how to handle errors using different patterns.

## üîç Approach Comparison

### `try`-`catch` Approach

The `try`-`catch` approach encapsulates async operations within a `try` block and uses `catch` to handle errors. While it provides a straightforward way to catch errors within the same code block, it might lead to repetitive error handling code if used extensively.

### Higher-Order Function (HOF) Approach

The HOF approach abstracts error handling logic into separate functions, enhancing code reusability and maintainability. By encapsulating error handling in dedicated functions, you can create consistent and modular error handling across your codebase.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage Examples

Two main functions, `mainTry()` and `mainCatch()`, showcase the two error handling patterns.

- `mainTry()`: Demonstrates the `try`-`catch` approach, where errors are caught using `try` and `catch` blocks. Each async operation is enclosed within its own `try`-`catch` block.

- `mainCatch()`: Demonstrates the HOF approach, where a reusable error handling function (`error_handle()`) is used with the `.catch()` method to handle errors.

Feel free to explore the code and choose the error handling pattern that aligns best with your project's needs!

## ‚ùì Which Approach to Choose?

Both approaches have their merits. The `try`-`catch` approach is simple and suitable for simpler error handling scenarios. On the other hand, the HOF approach shines in larger projects, promoting consistent and reusable error handling.

## üöÄ Get Started

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Explore the `asyncs.js` file to see different error handling patterns in action.
3. Experiment with both approaches to see which one fits your coding style and project requirements.

Happy coding! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
